### Housing

I booked an Aibnb with a very funny desciption : *Bedroom made by communist architect, number 3*.
It's even written on my room's door - that turned out to be number 4 ! See ("Socialist Apartment building Nr 4"):

The room is quite small (around 6mÂ²), but it's well equiped : a 2 place bed, a little desk, a wardrobe and at least 4 power outlet.
Everything is super clean and the kitchen, the living room, the toilets and the bathroom are shared with 3 other rooms.
The area is quiet and pleasant, there's a little park at the foot of the building with swings and seesaws for children.

### Observations about the city and the people

- The people I've seen are very polite and have good maners, in a way, we could say that they are well educated : they throw their garbages in trash cans, they only cross the roads when it's green, they won't let their dogs soil the streets ... The total opposite of Paris.
- They seem to prefer dogs over cats. I've seen many people with dogs, but the only cat I've seen was a wild cat; This cute little feline was holding a (dead) sparrow in its mouth !
- The old town is lovely (I'll talk about it later), but when you're 1km away from it, you'll just be surrounded by a ton of concrete buildings - everywhere - and that's not going to stop, many buildings are under construction. There are cranes from the suburbs of the city to the old town.
- It's been 2 days since I'm in Bratislava and I must have drink more than 7 coffee in 5 different places. Maybe I'm lucky, but all of these coffee were good, even excellent ! Also there is a impressive number of coffee shop in Bratislava. So I looked on the internet about coffee culture in Slovakia, and [here is a link](https://www.visitbratislava.com/your-visit/wining-and-dining/coffee/) that helped me understand why my coffees were so good.

### The food

8:00 AM, I was walking towards the old town and was starting to be hungry. A day ago, I read that I could eat Goulash for breakfast in small restaurant or hostel, so I've looked for it, but I couldn't find anything. I finally decieded to eat exactly what local people were eating at this moment of the morning (~8:30 AM) and ended up with some kind of sandwich in my hands.
It was more than a sandwich, like a panini : grilled with some cheese inside. But not mozarella, some weird cheese, that looked and tasted like raped Roquefort !

For the lunch, I ate a delicious cabbage soup, with oignons, chorizo, pork and several spices in it. It was served with some sort of fresh cream and some bread.
I also ordered a handmade limonade, that's not awesome at all, neither it is excellent, but that's something you couldn't find in Paris whereas in Bratislava, every restaurant has it on its menu.

### The visit

Visiting Bratislava can easly be done in one day. There are 5 very interesting places in Bratislava : The old town, the castle, St Martin's cathedral, Michael's gate and the blue church.
The castle itself is not very nice, but being there offers a large  view on the city. But don't look too far, because while the city center and the cathedral are really nice, if you look over it, the only thing you'll see is an endless set of concrete buildings - remnants of the USSR era.
The cathedral is impressive by its height and its beauty (maybe as every cathedral), and the inside is wonderful, especially the stained glasses. But more pleasant than the cathedral itself : the small and quaint streets that leads to it.
The old town is full of nice and old buildings, you could spend a day taking pictures of them. Walking in the old town feels like walking in Paris (without the cars) and taking pictures of every Hausmannian buildings.
Without any doubt, the part of the visit that I prefered was seeing the blue church. It's one of the most beautiful church I've ever seen if not the most beautiful.
