# Introduction

This is a little notebook for whoever is intressted in going to Eastern Europe or even for over-worried parents who wants to be daily updated about their son's situation.

My first plan was to take a flight to Amsterdam, stay there one day and then take another flight to Bucarest. But, unfortunatly, I've missed my plane.
Because I didn't want to wait 3 or 4 days to take another plane, I choosed to take the bus to Bratislava (Slovakia).
